/**
 * dsh-openreelbench host entry.
 *
 * The package ships this host entry together with its `dsh.client` browser
 * entry; `dsh.bundle.patch` inserts the plugin into a profile's layer stack.
 *
 * The plugin owns a state machine over a workspace directory and three tools.
 * ComfyUI generation is still delegated to dsh-comfyui's tools, while the
 * optional model API provider is called by the media route in this plugin.
 * That keeps the two plugins coupled only through the model's tool calls, so
 * neither has to depend on the other's service.
 *
 * Configuration has two doors into the same values: the loader entry in
 * cordis.yml, and the `openreel:` settings section the browser settings page
 * writes. One schema drives both, and changes land live — nothing here
 * snapshots a config value at apply time.
