/**
 * 配音 — the third gate: generate takes on top, voice on the bottom.
 *
 * Three things are worth knowing before reading the code.
 *
 * **Auditioning runs from the browser; generating does not.** Both could —
 * dsh-comfyui exposes its own routes and openreelbench's host never touches ComfyUI
 * either way — but the two calls differ in what a failure costs. An audition is
 * a preview: it produces no artifact, and a bad one is discarded by looking
 * away. Generation produces what the next stage consumes, and it fails in ways
 * that need judgement — a stale option list, a voice that reads wrong. Driving
 * it from here left the model unaware any of it had happened and left the user
 * watching a spinner while the real work scrolled past in a queue they could
 * not see. So generation is stated as a job and handed to the model, and this
 * screen watches the manifest for the result.
 *
 * **There is one take per section, and regenerating replaces it.** No version
 * picker, by decision: roll again until it is right. The file on disk keeps its
 * older siblings, but the manifest names exactly one, so "which take is live"
 * is never ambiguous — and compose, which reads the manifest, cannot pick up
 * the wrong one.
 *
 * **The card strip is a picker, not a timeline.** One uniform line per
 * section — ordinal, id, duration. A missing take is a dashed card, and the
 * count lives on the 全部 card at the end; stretching cards by duration would
 * duplicate what the waveform already shows and push later sections off
 * screen.
