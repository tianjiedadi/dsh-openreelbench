/**
 * dsh-openreelbench browser half.
 *
 * Today it contributes one surface: a standalone Settings page. It exists as a
 * separate plugin face because the host exposes `.volatile()` fields through
 * namespace and persists its values but renders nothing — the Settings sidebar
 * enumerates `settings.section` entries and mounts the active one in the
 * content column, so a page only appears for a plugin that ships a browser
 * half. A host-only plugin is invisible in Settings by construction.
 *
 * REGISTRATION TABLE — every surface this plugin contributes is one entry in
 * `apply` below, so growing the UI is adding an entry plus its component, not
 * restructuring this file. Slot names and their risk marks come from
 * `docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md` §8, the catalogue of all 48 mount points; check
 * a name there before adding a row, and prefer the `+` (additive) positions.
 * The M2 surfaces slot in here:
 *
 *   settings.section                  ← the Settings page (done; nav row id
 *                                       `openreel`, page content inside)
 *   tool.call.toolview  key=openreel_stage
 *                                     ← pipeline progress, and `awaiting_human`
 *                                       rendered as an approval card
 *   tool.call.toolview  key=openreel_show
 *                                     ← the media card (done)
 *   tool.call.toolview  key=openreel_compose
 *                                     ← the same card, so a finished render
 *                                       shows itself (done)
 *   conversation.input.dock           ← style / render-parameter strip
 *   conversation.session.header.actions
 *                                     ← a "films" button opening the library
 *
 * Rendering the pipeline through `tool.call.toolview` means the tool RESULT is
 * the data, so none of this needs `openreel_stage` to publish stage events onto
 * the session stream. A separate event stream would only be worth building for
 * a surface that has to show progress with no tool call on screen — the films
 * library, say — and not for anything M2 needs first.
 *
 * Contributions go through `slots.inject` rather than a bare `slots.register`
 * so they wait on the real slot declaration and unwind with this fiber.
