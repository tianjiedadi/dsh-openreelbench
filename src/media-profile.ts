/**
 * Platform render profiles — what frame the film is cut to, and what size the
 * pictures are generated at by default. API inputs can override their size
 * through project-local `api_visual_sizes` while compose uses this output frame.
 *
 * `brief.target_platform` used to be validated and then ignored: the schema
 * refused anything outside the list, and compose read width and height from the
 * global settings regardless. A project declared for 抖音 rendered 1920x1080.
 * A declaration nothing acts on is worse than no declaration, because it reads
 * like a decision that was made.
 *
 * THE RULE, as of the render-scale change: the platform decides the ASPECT
 * RATIO and the BASELINE resolution; one setting — `video.renderScale` —
 * multiplies that baseline; the product is the frame, and the SAME product is
 * what the image workflow is told to draw at. There is no separate output
 * resolution in settings any more, because there were two answers to one
 * question and only one of them reached the picture generator: a vertical
 * project's stills came back 16:9 and compose cropped the sides off.
 *
 * Baseline numbers follow OpenMontage's `lib/media_profiles.py` where the
 * platforms line up; the Chinese platforms are their own published upload specs.
