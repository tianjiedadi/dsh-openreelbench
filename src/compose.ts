/**
 * FFmpeg assembly: script + generated assets -> one narrated video.
 *
 * The ordering rule that makes this work is *measure first, then lay out*.
 * OpenMontage's `video_compose` trusts the timeline in the artifact; here the
 * script's `start_seconds` / `end_seconds` are treated as intent only, and the
 * real timeline is built from what ffprobe reports about each narration file.
 * TTS output is never the length the writer guessed, and every downstream
 * artifact — subtitles above all — has to agree with the audio that shipped.
 *
 * Pipeline per render:
 *   1. probe every narration clip
 *   2. pad each one to its section's on-screen length      -> work/audio-NNN.wav
 *   3. concat those into a single narration bed            -> work/narration.wav
 *   4. turn each still into a clip of the same length      -> work/video-NNN.mp4
 *   5. concat the clips (stream copy, uniform encode)      -> work/video.mp4
 *   6. mux bed + clips, optionally burning subtitles       -> output/<id>.mp4
 *
 * Segments are normalised to one codec, size, pixel format, SAR and frame rate
 * so step 5 can stream-copy. A mismatch there is what produces non-monotonous
 * DTS and silently corrupt output.
